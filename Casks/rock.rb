  # CLI companion — symlinks Rock.app's bundled bash launcher
  # to /usr/local/bin/rock so users can `rock` from any
  # terminal. The script execs Rock.app's bundled Electron
  # with ELECTRON_RUN_AS_NODE=1 (no Node runtime needed).
  # Subcommands: rock, rock open, rock bind, rock list,
  # rock send, rock focus, rock spawn, rock kill, rock doctor,
  # rock install theme claude.

  # Rock.app is currently signed with an ad-hoc signature
  # (no Apple Developer ID). Gatekeeper would otherwise

  # Strip the quarantine attribute on install so the cask
  # works without the user manually right-click → Open.
  # Once we have a Developer ID signature + notarization,
  # this block can come out.

  caveats <<~EOS
    Rock is a desktop terminal workspace app.

    For project-specific workspaces, bind rock to a project:
      cd ~/code/your-project
      rock bind

    Or open the default workspace:
      open -a Rock

    Match Claude Code's theme to Rock:
      rock install theme claude
